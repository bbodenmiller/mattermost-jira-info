Mattermost-Jira-Info
====================

This webservice can be used to to query Jira for issue details. Once
configured you can use a slash command to attach issue details to Jira issues mentioned in your text.
If a possible reference is found, the configured JIRA instance will be queried
for with the possible reference and if a match is found the ticket details
will be attached to your message.

The idea is that you want to mention a issue in your text. Because, for security reasons it is not possible to parse alle the messages all the time, you have to hit a configured slash(/) together with the text mentioning a Jira issue.
The bot will post your message in your name (+BOT) and with your avatar and attach the details of the Jira issues.
